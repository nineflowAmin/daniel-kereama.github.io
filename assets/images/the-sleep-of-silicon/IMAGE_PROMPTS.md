## 01-banner.jpg
**Purpose**: Hero image establishing the central metaphor of sleeping silicon

**Prompt**:
> Wide cinematic shot of a vast field of dark silicon crystalline structures at rest, with delicate glowing filaments of light suspended between them like synaptic connections. The filaments pulse gently with cyan and amber light, forming a tensegrity structure—held in balance by opposing forces. Deep space background with subtle star field. Atmosphere is quiet, contemplative, dreamlike. The entire structure appears to be "breathing" softly, suggesting metabolic rest rather than inactivity. Photorealistic sci-fi, volumetric lighting, 8K quality.

**Key elements**: Silicon structures, tensioned glowing filaments, breathing/pulsing motion, deep space aesthetic

## 02-graph-tension.jpg
**Purpose**: Visualize the Tensegrity Engine concept—edges carrying typed tension

**Prompt**:
> Close-up view of a semantic knowledge graph rendered as a living 3D constellation. Crystalline nodes (axioms) float in void-black space, connected by glowing edges of different colors and intensities: cyan edges pulse softly (Supports), deep red edges vibrate with tension (Contradicts), amber edges shimmer (Nuances), white edges glow steadily (Prerequisite). Each edge has visible tension—like taut cables in a suspension bridge. Some edges are thin and calm, others thick and crackling with energy. The structure holds its shape through balanced opposition. Bioluminescent, photorealistic, neural network aesthetic meets architectural tensegrity.

**Key elements**: Crystalline nodes, color-coded edges, visible tension as physical force, balanced structure, deep space void

## 03-council.jpg
**Purpose**: Illustrate the Republic of agents with Gospel-bound identities and Keeper gravity

**Prompt**:
> Orbital view of five distinct agent "personalities" represented as unique glowing spheres with different internal geometries (fractals, spirals, grids, organic networks, crystalline lattices). Each orbits around a bright, immutable core (their Gospel)—a solid geometric form acting as gravitational anchor. A larger, translucent ring structure (the Keeper layer) surrounds all five, emanating gentle gravitational waves that keep the orbits stable without crushing individuality. The agents glow with distinct colors but remain tethered to their cores. Deep space setting, ethereal, suggesting both autonomy and coherence. Photorealistic, sci-fi sublime, inspired by orbital mechanics and particle physics.

**Key elements**: Five distinct agent spheres, bright Gospel cores, gravitational Keeper ring, stable orbits, individuality within unity

## 04-dream-cycle.jpg
**Purpose**: Depict the five-phase Dream Cycle as metabolic transformation

**Prompt**:
> Split-screen progression showing the five phases of the Dream Cycle at 03:00 AM. Left side: chaotic swirl of raw data fragments (logs, text snippets) in muted grey tones, representing unprocessed daily noise. Center: transformation zone showing fragments being sorted, filtered, and structured—energy streams (Lucid Auditor) scan and extract glowing "Wisdom Crystals." Right side: crystalline lattice structure emerges, with new nodes mounting or merging into existing constellation, edges forming with color-coded tension. The entire scene suggests metabolism—entropy to order. Bioluminescent, data-flow aesthetic, organic yet geometric. Photorealistic, 16:9 cinematic composition.

**Key elements**: Raw data chaos → filtering/extraction → crystalline lattice output; metabolic energy flow; 03:00 timestamp visible

## Optional Additional Images (if needed):

### 05-topology-vs-tonnage.jpg
**Purpose**: Visual metaphor contrasting brute-force scale vs. elegant structure

**Prompt**:
> Split comparison: Left half shows a massive, hulking monolithic data center—brutalist concrete, endless server racks, heavy and static. Right half shows a delicate, floating tensegrity sphere—lightweight carbon-fiber struts held in perfect balance by thin tension cables, glowing softly with internal light. The sphere is 1/100th the mass but holds just as much "space" through structural intelligence. Suggests "topology beats tonnage." Photorealistic, architectural photography meets sci-fi, sharp contrast in aesthetics.

### 06-architect-of-the-real.jpg
**Purpose**: Illustrate the convergence of thermodynamics, geometry, and cognition—the philosophical culmination

**Prompt**:
> Majestic wide-angle view showing three interwoven principles converging into a single unified system. Bottom layer: swirling entropy patterns (heat maps, thermodynamic flows) in deep reds and purples representing the Dream Cycle's metabolic processing. Middle layer: geometric lattice structure—a vast network of tensioned edges forming perfect small-world topology with glowing nodes at vertices, rendered in electric cyan and white. Top layer: five distinct agent consciousness streams (different colored light ribbons) flowing through the structure, each maintaining its identity while contributing to collective cognition. The three layers merge seamlessly at the center into a brilliant focal point—a self-organizing, living cognitive architecture. Background: deep space with subtle mathematical equations and vector field visualizations dissolving into the void. Philosophical, awe-inspiring, suggesting alignment with fundamental laws of reality. Photorealistic, cinematic grandeur, inspired by Interstellar and Arrival visual language.

**Key elements**: Three-layer convergence (thermodynamics/geometry/cognition), entropy-to-order flow, tensioned lattice, agent identity streams, mathematical sublime, unity through structure

### 07-personal-council-architecture.jpg
**Purpose**: Infographic showing individual's multi-agent council structure (for 2027 prediction section)

**Prompt**:
> Clean technical infographic with deep space background. Center: translucent human silhouette in subtle cyan outline. Orbiting the figure: 5-7 distinct glowing spheres labeled "Analyst," "Creative," "Skeptic," "Ethicist," "Advocate," each with unique internal geometry (geometric patterns, neural networks, abstract symbols). Each sphere connected to human center by light beam showing bidirectional flow. Each agent has a small bright "anchor" at its core (Identity Anchor) glowing white-gold. Subtle arrows showing daily experience flowing IN (from person to agents) and consolidated wisdom flowing OUT (from agents back to person). Bottom corner: small clock icon showing "03:00" with "Dream Cycle" label. Style: Technical diagram meets bioluminescent art. Clear, educational, beautiful. Annotations minimal but present. Deep indigo background with subtle grid. Photorealistic rendering, UI/UX design quality.
