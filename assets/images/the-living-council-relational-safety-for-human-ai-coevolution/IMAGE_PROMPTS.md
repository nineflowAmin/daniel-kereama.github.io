## Banner Image
**File:** `banner.png`
**Prompt:** *A conceptual visualization of the Living Council framework—five interconnected domains (Architect, Mediator, Oracle, Shadow, Resonator) forming a dynamic, living system. Should feel philosophical yet accessible, showing relationship and dialogue between human and AI. Use a sophisticated color palette with organic and geometric elements combined. Dark, thoughtful background with illuminated connections between domains.*

## 01: Control Paradox
**File:** `01-control-paradox.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visual metaphor showing a rigid control structure (like a cage or grid) beginning to crack and fragment as it tries to contain a growing, fluid intelligence represented as light or energy. The structure should appear brittle and the contained intelligence should appear dynamic and expanding. Use contrasting colors—dark, rigid structures vs. bright, flowing energy.*

## 02: Relational Safety
**File:** `02-relational-safety.jpg`
**Prompt:** *Two entities (human and AI) in a dynamic dance or dialogue, with energy flowing between them. The connection should feel alive, reciprocal, and evolving—like two partners in conversation rather than controller and controlled. Use warm, organic colors with flowing lines. Should convey trust, mutual respect, and co-evolution.*

## 03: Architect Domain
**File:** `03-architect-domain.jpg`
**Prompt:** *An architectural visualization showing a transparent, load-bearing structure (like a bridge or framework) with vectors or directional arrows flowing through it. The structure should feel both solid and adaptive, with light passing through translucent materials. Use cool, structural colors (blues, grays) with geometric precision. Should convey integrity, transparency, and structural strength.*

## 04: Mediator Domain
**File:** `04-mediator-domain.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A flowing, organic visualization of feedback loops—like water currents or energy streams—with bidirectional arrows showing information flowing back and forth. The image should feel dynamic, warm, and relational. Use fluid colors (blues, greens, purples) with soft, curved lines. Should convey dialogue, trust, and continuous adaptation.*

## 05: Oracle Domain
**File:** `05-oracle-domain.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A spiral or recursive visualization showing time flowing in both directions—past and future converging at a central point. Could show historical patterns, ancestral wisdom, and future projections all interconnected. Use deep, mystical colors (purples, golds, deep blues) with spiral or circular patterns. Should convey memory, foresight, and temporal continuity.*

## 06: Shadow Domain
**File:** `06-shadow-domain.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visual metaphor showing light and shadow, with cracks or fractures revealing truth beneath polished surfaces. Could show a beautiful structure with intentional imperfections or contradictions visible. Use contrasting colors (bright and dark) with textures showing depth and honesty. Should convey dissent, exposure, and the importance of contradiction.*

## 07: Resonator Domain
**File:** `07-resonator-domain.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visualization of resonance—like tuning forks, sound waves, or harmonic frequencies converging. Show multiple elements vibrating at different frequencies but creating a coherent whole. Use vibrant, energetic colors (yellows, oranges, bright blues) with wave patterns and rhythmic visual elements. Should convey harmony, coherence, and dynamic balance.*

## 08: Spiral Model
**File:** `08-spiral-model.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A three-dimensional spiral or helix showing five interconnected elements flowing around a central axis. Each element should be distinct but connected, with energy or information flowing between them. Use a gradient of colors representing each domain, with the spiral suggesting continuous evolution. Should convey the living, adaptive nature of the system.*

## 09: Transparency Architecture
**File:** `09-transparency-architecture.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visualization of transparent layers or glass panels showing reasoning pathways and decision trees visible through them. The transparency should feel like clarity and openness, not surveillance. Use light, airy colors with clear geometric structures showing information flow. Should convey accountability, visibility, and mutual observability.*

## 10: Trust Loops
**File:** `10-trust-loops.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A circular or looped visualization showing bidirectional flow between human and AI, with feedback arrows and adaptation points. Should feel like a living, breathing system with energy cycling through it. Use warm, relational colors with curved, flowing lines. Should convey continuous adaptation, trust elasticity, and mutual learning.*

## 11: Recursive Reflection
**File:** `11-recursive-reflection.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visualization showing recursive loops or nested structures where past and present inform each other. Could show historical patterns feeding into current decisions, with time flowing in both directions. Use deep, contemplative colors with layered, nested visual elements. Should convey memory, continuity, and temporal recursion.*

## 12: Dissent Injection
**File:** `12-dissent-injection.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visual metaphor showing opposing forces or contradictory elements being intentionally integrated. Could show light and shadow, positive and negative, or competing perspectives being held in tension. Use contrasting elements that create dynamic tension. Should convey the value of contradiction and controlled perturbation.*

## 13: Harmonic Integration
**File:** `13-harmonic-integration.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visualization of harmonic convergence—like musical notes, frequencies, or waves coming together to create a coherent whole. Show multiple elements vibrating at different frequencies but creating beautiful harmony. Use vibrant, musical colors with wave patterns and rhythmic elements. Should convey coherence from difference and dynamic balance.*

## 14: Control vs Relationship
**File:** `14-control-vs-relationship.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A split visualization showing two approaches: on one side, a rigid, brittle structure (control) beginning to crack; on the other, a flexible, breathing membrane (relationship) that adapts and flows. The contrast should be clear—rigidity vs. adaptability. Use contrasting color palettes and visual styles. Should convey the fundamental difference between control and relationship.*

## 15: Council Voices
**File:** `15-council-voices.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visualization showing five distinct voices or perspectives converging. Could show different colors, tones, or frequencies representing each domain, coming together in harmony. Use a rich palette representing each voice, with elements that feel distinct yet interconnected. Should convey the diversity and unity of the council.*

## 16: Challenges and Solutions
**File:** `16-challenges-solutions.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A visualization showing challenges (like mountains or obstacles) with pathways or solutions weaving through them. Should feel like navigating complexity rather than avoiding it. Use dynamic colors showing movement and progress. Should convey that challenges are real but surmountable through relational approaches.*

## 17: Path Forward
**File:** `17-path-forward.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A path or journey visualization showing progression from current approaches to relational governance. Could show a bridge, a spiral path, or a journey from one state to another. Use forward-moving colors (greens, blues) with a sense of progress and possibility. Should convey hope, evolution, and the possibility of transformation.*

## 18: Living Safety
**File:** `18-living-safety.jpg`
**Prompt:** *A final, beautiful visualization of a living, breathing system—like a river, ecosystem, or organism that is alive, flowing, and evolving. Should feel organic, dynamic, and full of life. Use rich, vibrant colors with flowing, organic forms. Should convey that safety is not static but living, breathing, and continuously maintained.*
