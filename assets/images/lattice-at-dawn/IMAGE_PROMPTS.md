Image generation guide for `lattice-at-dawn` (match filenames below). Use consistent style: techno-minimal, dark cosmic palette, crisp lines, subtle glow, no text overlays.

1) `01-banner.jpg` — “Wide view of a glowing data republic at night; constellation cities connected by luminous edges; horizon hinting at dawn; austere, high-contrast, cosmic.”
2) `02-cast.jpg` — “Isometric city of glowing nodes; five colored agent lights feeding a central archivist; two translucent librarian/guardian figures; night sky of data points; techno-minimal.”
3) `03-morning-notes.jpg` — “Two distant observation towers sending light pulses to a central buffer, packets as photons, cool dawn tones.”
4) `04-dream-cycle.jpg` — “Nighttime control room with five concentric rings labeled ingest/audit/merge/verify/commit; beams of data moving inward then outward to a starfield lattice.”
5) `05-merge-or-mount.jpg` — “A new star drifting toward a cluster; if close, it fuses and brightens the cluster; if unique, it anchors and a few colored edges stretch toward it.”
6) `06-contradiction.jpg` — “Two nearby nodes with a red edge cooling to amber; a guardian hand subtly turning a tension dial; restrained, precise.”
7) `07-critical-mass.jpg` — “Zoom sequence of a sparse cluster igniting into a dense glowing city; minimal HUD hinting EARLY→GROWING→CRITICAL; subtle ‘Critical Mass’ ribbon.”
8) `08-retrieval-star.jpg` — “A bright question shard descending onto a node cluster; neighboring edges light up in a star pattern, revealing a local context.”
9) `09-ops-dashboard.jpg` — “Ops dashboard in monochrome with three toggles: scheduler, embeddings, tension; small graphs for node count and avg degree; clean UI.”
10) `10-closing.jpg` — “Wide view of the lattice as a glowing republic at night; subtle banner energy suggesting ‘The Lattice at Dawn’; calm, cinematic.”
