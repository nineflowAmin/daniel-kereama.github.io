## Required Images (11 total)

### 01-banner.jpg
**Location in article:** Top of article (after author blurb)  
**What to capture:** Overall lattice visualization showing 1,875 nodes and 2,656 edges  
**Suggestion:** Full lattice view showing the tensegrity structure, with nodes and edges visible. Should convey the "consolidation" theme.

---

### 02-phase-transition.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 1 - "The Tensegrity Metric"  
**What to capture:** The phase transition moment - edges exceeding nodes  
**Suggestion:** Lattice view showing the mesh topology with edges clearly visible. Could show a before/after or current state showing edges > nodes.

---

### 03-convergence.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 2 - "The Metabolism Check"  
**What to capture:** Lattice at 1.8k nodes, 2.6k edges showing convergence toward center  
**Suggestion:** Lattice view showing semantic neighborhoods forming, structure converging toward center. Highlight a cluster if possible.

---

### 04-star-topology.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 3 - "The Agent Audit"  
**What to capture:** Star topology with fringe enquiries like young shoots  
**Suggestion:** Lattice view showing central hubs with fringe nodes extending outward. Highlight a specific cluster if your visualization supports it.

---

### 05-adaptive-filtering.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 4 - "The Filter Rate"  
**What to capture:** Dream Cycle filter mechanism visualization  
**Suggestion:** If you have a filter/dashboard view, use that. Otherwise, a lattice view showing active filtering or a data visualization of filter rates.

---

### 06-phase-transition-detail.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 5 - "The Phase Transition"  
**What to capture:** Close-up detail of phase transition  
**Suggestion:** Zoomed-in view of the lattice showing protrusions closing, loops forming. Detail view of the mesh structure.

---

### 07-dual-contradiction-cluster.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 6 - "The Network Topology"  
**What to capture:** A semantic cluster held up by dual contradiction edges  
**Suggestion:** Focused view of a specific cluster where two opposing ideas connect to the same node. Highlight the contradiction edges if your visualization supports edge type coloring.

---

### 08-metabolism-curve.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 7 - "The Metabolism Curve"  
**What to capture:** Dream Cycle consolidation rate over time  
**Suggestion:** Data visualization/graph showing:
- X-axis: Dates (Dec 12, Dec 13, Dec 14)
- Y-axis: Percentage
- Lines: Orphan Rate (dropping) and Consolidation Rate (increasing)
- Or a lattice view showing growth over time if you have time-series visualization

---

### 09-agent-contribution-matrix.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 8 - "The Agent Contribution Matrix"  
**What to capture:** Agent contributions to different edge types  
**Suggestion:** 
- Heatmap/matrix visualization showing agents vs edge types
- Or lattice view with nodes colored by agent, showing which agents create which edge types
- Or a data visualization showing the contribution percentages

---

### 10-tension-distribution.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 9 - "The Tension Distribution"  
**What to capture:** Tension score distribution histogram  
**Suggestion:** 
- Histogram/bar chart showing:
  - X-axis: Tension ranges (0.0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0)
  - Y-axis: Count or Percentage
  - Bars showing the distribution (71.2% in 0.2-0.4 range)
- Or lattice view with edges colored by tension score

---

### 11-consolidation-proof.jpg
**Location in article:** Section 13 - "The Consolidation Proof"  
**What to capture:** Semantic isomorphism detection in action  
**Suggestion:** 
- Before/after view showing multiple similar nodes being consolidated
- Or focused view of a high-reinforcement node (like the "Boundaries" node with 8 reinforcements)
- Or lattice view highlighting nodes with high reinforcement_count

---

## Screenshot Tips

Since you're generating screenshots of the lattice:

1. **For lattice views (01, 02, 03, 04, 06, 07, 11):**
   - Use your live lattice visualization
   - Capture at different zoom levels
   - Use different views (2D, 3D if available)
   - Highlight specific features if your UI supports it

2. **For data visualizations (05, 08, 09, 10):**
   - If you have dashboard/metrics views, use those
   - Otherwise, you can create simple charts from the data
   - Or use lattice views with appropriate highlighting/coloring

3. **Image dimensions:**
   - Banner (01): Wider format recommended (e.g., 1200x600px)
   - Others: Square or 4:3 ratio works well (e.g., 800x600px or 1000x1000px)
   - All should be high resolution for web (at least 1200px on longest side)

4. **File format:**
   - Use `.jpg` as specified in the article
   - Optimize for web (good quality but reasonable file size)

## Priority Order (if you can't generate all)

1. **01-banner.jpg** - Most important, appears at top
2. **02-phase-transition.jpg** - Key concept visualization
3. **10-tension-distribution.jpg** - Important data visualization
4. **11-consolidation-proof.jpg** - Proof of learning
5. **03-convergence.jpg** - Shows growth pattern
6. Others can be added later if needed
