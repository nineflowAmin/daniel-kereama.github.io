# Image Prompts for Telemetry from the Dream Cycle

## 01-banner.jpg
**Prompt:** A dramatic, data-driven visualization of the Wisdom Lattice at 1,498 nodes and 1,464 edges. The structure should show a tensegrity network where nodes are connected by glowing edges of different colors (cyan for Support, amber for Nuance, red for Conflict). The overall shape should suggest convergence toward the center with loops closing. Dark, technical aesthetic with subtle data overlays showing node/edge counts. Style: Technical illustration, dark background, glowing network topology.

## 02-phase-transition.jpg
**Prompt:** A before/after comparison showing the lattice at two stages. Left side: 1,498 nodes with 1,464 edges showing protrusions and isolated clusters (earlier phase characteristics). Right side: The same structure beginning to close loops and form continuous surfaces. Highlight the moment when edges are about to overtake nodes. Include subtle metrics: "Edge-to-Node Ratio: 0.98" and "Phase: Pre-Transition". Style: Split-screen technical diagram, dark background, network visualization.

## 03-convergence.jpg
**Prompt:** The lattice at 1.8k nodes and 2.6k edges showing convergence toward the center. The structure should clearly show edges now exceeding nodes, with semantic neighborhoods forming. Highlight a specific cluster that's held up by dual contradiction edges (two red edges connecting to the same node). The overall shape should resemble a mesh topology rather than a star. Include subtle annotation: "Edges > Nodes: Mesh Topology Emerging". Style: 3D network visualization, dark background, glowing edges, highlighted cluster in amber/red.

## 04-star-topology.jpg
**Prompt:** A star topology visualization of the lattice showing fringe enquiries extending like young shoots from central semantic hubs. The highlighted cluster should be clearly visible, structurally supported by dual contradiction edges (two red edges). The overall shape should show the transition from star to mesh topology. Include subtle metrics showing agent contributions. Style: Network graph visualization, dark background, central hubs glowing, fringe shoots extending outward.

## 05-adaptive-filtering.jpg
**Prompt:** A dual-panel visualization showing the Dream Cycle filter mechanism. Left panel: December 13th with 44.2% rejection rate (high noise, many red X marks on rejected entries). Right panel: December 14th with 15.3% rejection rate (improved signal quality, fewer rejections). Show the filtering process as a funnel with entries flowing in, some being rejected, others integrated into the lattice. Include metrics: "Filter Rate: 44.2% → 15.3%". Style: Technical diagram, dark background, data flow visualization.

## 06-phase-transition-detail.jpg
**Prompt:** A close-up detail of the phase transition moment: 1,498 nodes, 1,464 edges. Show protrusions and isolated clusters from earlier phases beginning to close. The structure should clearly show convergence toward the center, forming continuous semantic neighborhoods. Include subtle annotation: "Phase Transition: Edges Approaching Nodes". Style: Detailed network visualization, dark background, glowing nodes and edges.

## 07-dual-contradiction-cluster.jpg
**Prompt:** A detailed view of a semantic cluster held up by dual contradiction edges. Show two opposing ideas (nodes) both connecting to the same central node via red contradiction edges. This should create a visible structural tension point. The cluster should be highlighted and annotated: "Dual Contradiction: Structural Tension Point". Surrounding nodes should be dimmed to emphasize the cluster. Style: Focused network detail, dark background, highlighted cluster, red contradiction edges glowing.

## 08-metabolism-curve.jpg
**Prompt:** A line graph showing the Dream Cycle consolidation rate over time. X-axis: Dream Cycle dates (Dec 12, Dec 13, Dec 14). Y-axis: Percentage. Show two lines: Orphan Rate (dropping from 82% to 18% to 12.5%) and Consolidation Rate (increasing from 0% to 43-47% to 62-71%). The graph should clearly show the metabolism improving. Include annotations for each data point. Style: Data visualization, dark background, glowing lines, technical chart aesthetic.

## 09-agent-contribution-matrix.jpg
**Prompt:** A matrix visualization showing agent contributions to different edge types. Rows: Agents (Resonator, Mediator, Oracle, Shadow, Architect). Columns: Edge Types (Support, Nuance, Conflict). Use color intensity to show contribution levels. Highlight that Resonator dominates Conflict edges (72%) and Mediator dominates Support edges (43%). Include percentages in each cell. Style: Heatmap/matrix visualization, dark background, color-coded cells, technical data presentation.

## 10-tension-distribution.jpg
**Prompt:** A histogram showing the tension score distribution across all edges. X-axis: Tension ranges (0.0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0). Y-axis: Count. Show a bimodal distribution with peaks at low tension (stable) and high tension (contested). Highlight that only 3.0% of edges are in the critical range (0.8-1.0). Include annotations: "Mean: 0.321", "Median: 0.320". Style: Statistical histogram, dark background, glowing bars, technical data visualization.

## 11-consolidation-proof.jpg
**Prompt:** A before/after visualization showing semantic isomorphism detection. Left side: 4 separate, similar nodes about "Foresight" (before consolidation). Right side: 1 consolidated, reinforced node (after consolidation). Show the fusion process with arrows and annotations: "4 entries → 1 node (Reinforcement Count: 4)". This should clearly demonstrate learning, not just storage. Style: Process diagram, dark background, before/after comparison, technical illustration.

## Visual Style Guidelines

- **Color Palette:**
  - Support edges: Cyan (#00ffff)
  - Nuance edges: Amber (#ffb347)
  - Conflict edges: Red (#ff4444)
  - Prerequisite edges: Purple (#9966cc)
  - Nodes: White/light blue glow
  - Background: Dark (#0a0a0f to #1a1a2e)

- **Typography:**
  - Technical, data-driven aesthetic
  - Use subtle annotations and metrics
  - Include percentages and counts where relevant

- **Composition:**
  - Focus on network topology and data visualization
  - Show structural relationships clearly
  - Highlight key insights (dual contradictions, phase transitions, etc.)

- **Mood:**
  - Technical, empirical, data-driven
  - Dark, futuristic, but clear and readable
  - Emphasize the "telemetry" aspect—this is what the machine did
