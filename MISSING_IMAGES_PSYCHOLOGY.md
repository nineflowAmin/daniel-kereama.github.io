## Images You Still Need to Generate (6 total)

### 1. Banner Image
**Filename**: `banner.png` (or `banner.jpg`)

**Image Prompt**:
```
A hero/banner image for "Psychology as System Physics: Building Emergent Multi-Agent Systems". Wide format (1200x400px or similar). Visual concept showing the intersection of psychology, AI systems, and natural world patterns. Abstract representation of multi-agent systems with natural elements - perhaps neural networks overlaying natural landscapes, or psychological concepts (thought patterns, tension, feedback loops) transforming into physical structures. Modern, professional, tech-forward aesthetic with Nineflow brand colors (indigo, purple, cyan gradients). Should convey the theme of psychology functioning as system physics in AI architecture.

### 2. Natural Memory Systems
**Filename**: `09-natural-memory-systems.jpg`

**Section**: Memory Creates Persistent Identity

**Image Prompt**:
```
Natural memory systems—like how trees form growth rings that remember past seasons, or how coral reefs build layers that remember environmental history, or how animal migration paths are remembered across generations. Each natural system maintaining its own memory while contributing to collective knowledge. Macro photography of natural memory structures: tree rings showing years of growth, coral layers revealing environmental history, geological strata telling time, or animal migration patterns passed down through generations. The natural world's way of maintaining persistent identity through memory. Scientific photography showing memory as a natural phenomenon, with visible layers, patterns, and historical records embedded in natural structures.

### 3. Structure and Variation
**Filename**: `10-structure-and-variation.jpg`

**Section**: Deterministic Scaffolding Enables Non-Deterministic Intelligence

**Image Prompt**:
```
Natural systems with structured foundations enabling creative variation—like how DNA provides structure but allows infinite variation in life forms, or how musical scales provide structure but allow infinite melodies, or how crystal lattices provide structure but allow unique formations. The balance between structure and creativity in nature. Abstract scientific art showing structure + variation: DNA helix with diverse life forms emerging from it, musical notation with flowing melodies, crystal lattice structures with unique formations, or architectural frameworks with creative variations. The natural world's way of using deterministic structure to enable non-deterministic creativity. Conceptual art blending scientific precision with organic variation.

### 4. Resonance Propagation
**Filename**: `11-resonance-propagation.jpg`

**Section**: Resonance Propagation Example

**Image Prompt**:
```
Natural networks showing influence propagation—like mycelium networks connecting trees in a forest, or neural pathways in a brain, or root systems connecting plants. Information and energy flowing through natural networks, with visible propagation patterns. Scientific visualization of natural networks with flowing energy: underground mycelium networks connecting forest trees (visible as glowing connections), neural pathways in a brain showing signal propagation, intricate root systems connecting plants underground, or vascular systems in leaves showing nutrient flow. The natural world's way of propagating influence and information through interconnected networks. Scientific photography or visualization showing visible energy/information flows through natural network structures.

### 5. Shadow Challenges
**Filename**: `12-shadow-challenges.jpg`

**Section**: The Shadow Clause: Real-World Challenges

**Image Prompt**:
```
Natural systems facing real-world challenges—like a forest ecosystem dealing with invasive species (complexity), or a river system with hidden currents (observability gaps), or migratory animals balancing speed vs. safety (latency vs. fidelity), or a predator-prey balance requiring constant adjustment (safety-innovation tension). The natural world's way of managing trade-offs and challenges. Documentary-style nature photography showing natural challenges and adaptations: a forest with invasive species visible, a river with turbulent hidden currents, migratory birds balancing flight speed with safety, or predator-prey dynamics showing the constant tension between safety and innovation. Real-world natural systems dealing with complexity, observability gaps, trade-offs, and constant adaptation. Cinematic nature photography showing both the challenges and the adaptive responses.

### 6. AI and Nature Convergence
**Filename**: `15-ai-nature-convergence.jpg`

**Section**: From Mimicry to Physics: Integrated Conclusion

**Image Prompt**:
```
A visual bridge between artificial and natural intelligence—like a neural network overlay on a forest ecosystem, or code structures morphing into natural patterns, or AI agents represented as natural organisms. The convergence of artificial and biological intelligence, showing how both follow similar physics. Conceptual art blending tech and nature, showing the future of AI as natural system dynamics. Abstract representation: neural network patterns overlaying a forest landscape, code structures transforming into tree branches or root systems, AI agents visualized as natural organisms (birds, fish, plants) working together, or digital patterns merging with organic forms. The convergence showing that artificial and biological intelligence follow similar underlying physics. Modern conceptual art with Nineflow brand colors, showing the future of AI as natural system dynamics rather than just computational models.
