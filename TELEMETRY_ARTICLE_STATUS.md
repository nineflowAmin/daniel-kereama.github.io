   - 11 detailed image prompts matching article sections
   - Technical, data-driven aesthetic guidelines

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Step 1: Run Priority 1 Queries
Run the 7 core queries from `TELEMETRY_QUERY_REQUESTS.md` and provide results:
- Query 1: Lattice Overview (nodes, edges, agents)
- Query 2: Edge Type Distribution
- Query 3: Memory Maturity Stages
- Query 4: Agent Contributions with Tension
- Query 5: Most Connected Nodes
- Query 6: Orphan Nodes Count
- Query 7: Tension Distribution

### Step 2: Data Insertion
I'll update the article with your real data, replacing all placeholders like:
- `[NODE_COUNT]` → actual node count
- `[EDGE_COUNT]` → actual edge count
- `[AGENT_1]`, `[TENSION_1]`, etc. → actual agent data
- All percentages and metrics

### Step 3: Optional Enhancements
If you want to enhance further, run Priority 2 queries:
- Query 8: Agent Edge Type Contribution
- Query 9: Growth Timeline
- Query 10: High Tension Edges Examples
- Query 11: Branch Points (Dual Contradiction Clusters)
- Query 12: Causal Chains

### Step 4: Generate Images
Use the prompts in `IMAGE_PROMPTS.md` to generate the 11 images needed for the article.

## 📋 Placeholder Format

The article uses placeholders in the format `[PLACEHOLDER_NAME]`. When you provide query results, I'll replace:
- `[NODE_COUNT]` → actual number
- `[EDGE_COUNT]` → actual number
- `[AGENT_1]`, `[AGENT_2]`, etc. → actual agent names
- `[TENSION_1]`, `[TENSION_2]`, etc. → actual tension scores
- `[DATE_1]`, `[DATE_2]`, etc. → actual dates
- All percentages, counts, and metrics

## 🎯 Article Goals

✅ **Show real telemetry** - No mock data, all from production database
✅ **Demonstrate leadership** - Through data, not claims
✅ **Enable engagement** - Clear call-to-action for Nineflow contact
✅ **Provide value** - Actionable insights for others building similar systems
✅ **Maintain authenticity** - Every number is falsifiable, every query is provided

## 📞 Call-to-Action Section

The article now includes a clear "Building Collective Emergent Intelligence" section that:
- Positions Nineflow as actively working with organizations
- Lists specialization areas (Collective Intelligence, Graph Memory, Dream Cycles, Tensegrity Engineering)
- Provides engagement channels (website, LinkedIn, email)
- Emphasizes building in public and collaboration

## 🔍 Verification

All SQL queries are provided in the appendix. Readers can verify every claim by running the same queries against their own systems (if they have similar schemas) or by understanding the methodology.

**Ready for your query results!** Once you provide the Priority 1 query results, I'll update the article with real data and it will be ready to publish.
