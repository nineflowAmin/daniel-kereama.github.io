## Questions to Ask Yourself/Your Team

### About the System:
1. What specific technical problem did the Living Council framework help solve?
2. Which domain (Architect, Mediator, Oracle, Shadow, Resonator) is most evident in your current implementation?
3. What would break if you removed relational governance principles?
4. How do you measure if the system is "working" relationally?

### About the Article:
1. What's the primary goal: thought leadership, consulting, or collaboration?
2. Who is the target audience: researchers, enterprise clients, or both?
3. What's the one thing you want readers to do after reading?

## Next Steps After Gathering

Once materials are collected, we will:
1. Create "Applied Insight" case studies
2. Build the "For the Pragmatist" sidebar
3. Add concrete implementation examples
4. Create the bridge paragraph connecting theory to practice
5. Update the Implementation section with real-world steps

## Notes

- Don't worry if some items don't exist yet—we can describe what they would look like
- Focus on quality over quantity—one strong example is better than many weak ones
- Think about what makes your approach unique and different
- Consider what would convince a skeptical enterprise client
